### Overview
![Only Coins Social Layer](https://github.com/Good-Fortune-Felines-Core-Team/Grants-Program/assets/103082550/9aa32bbf-182d-4e13-beb5-f7657e73c892)

- Only Coins is the premiere decentralized video sharing platform designed for web3 creators & powered by the BOS.
  
- Using inspiration from major video sharing platform designs, Only Coins will provide an on-chain solution for users to upload and share videos via a social layer tied to the BOS & Near Social. Each unique profile will have a feed of videos from followed and suggested creators. Users will be able to gate specific content behind a subscription, fee, or donation. Users can also publicly tip creators for specific pieces of content if they wish.


- Only Coins is designed as a censorship-resistant platform specific to crypto content creators and community members from all web3 ecosystems. Only coins will be powered by the BOS with interactions stored on-chain allowing for increased transparency and accessibility.
Through BOS and Near Social integration, Only Coins will foster a community where creators can have full control of their profiles, content, and monetization without outside interference.
Users will be able to upload/share content via their Near social profiles and interact with other content on their social feed.

- On October 7th 2023, the Neko Tik Tok account was banned without warning after over a year of creating educational and positive content related to Near protocol and the broader crypto community. Without any warning our account was permanently banned, with access to 500+ videos lost from the platform. The majority of the videos were educational/entertaining content from the Neko Learn-2-earn program which did not violate any portion of the terms & conditions from the platform. We immediately appealed the ban to no avail. 
Censorship and demonetization of video content on platforms like youtube and twitch has been a growing issue as these services have become increasingly popular. While data on demonetization is withheld, the requirements and restrictions imposed by these platforms have affected a majority of content creators and have had especially large repercussions for web3 related content. Many creators are looking to alternate monetization and hosting solutions often resorting to methods like Patreon and donations to receive funding.

- We have decided to create our own platform, Only Coins, on Near prootocl to address the issue.


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- **Cloud Service Layering:** Only coins will use a proprietary contract to allow Near wallet to connect and allocate cloud service credentiasl with implied limits / conditions in the contract. Users will be able to utilize the contract to interface with google cloud services allowing for all interactions and engagement with content to be viewed and recorded on-chain.
- **Content Manager:** Users will be able to manage and control their content, including visibility, access, monetization, and more.
- **Content Feed:** A TikTok-like video feed that serves crypto content to users based on their preferences and interactions.
- **Content Aggregation:** An automatic web scraper that brings in crypto content from diverse sources.
- **Profiles:** Every user and content creator has a profile. These profiles will include a bio, content display, and a crypto wallet address for direct tipping.
- **Monetization System:** Users will be able to directly monetize their channel or specific content according to their preferences. Platform will take minimal fee of subscriptions/payments (5% comparable to Patreon)
- **Tipping Mechanism:** An integrated system where viewers can directly tip creators (and other users) in cryptocurrency. Platform will take small fee (1%)

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- The digital space is burgeoning with opportunities, but the rampant censorship experienced by crypto content creators threatens to stifle innovation and freedom of expression. Our solution, the “Only Coins” app, is designed to tackle this issue head-on and provide a decentralized platform where creativity and crypto converge without constraints.
- Our Target audience is web3 content creators, content consumers and the Near/Web3 community.
- Our project provides a space where content creators can create and be rewarded for thier content, in conjunction with web3 social platform integration focused on creator content & powered by the BOS.
- There are not any similar projects to Only Coins right now. Only Coins provides much needed utility and use case not offered anywhere else on web3.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- Relevant Research Articles: Algorithmic Censorship by Social Platforms: Power and Resistance, YouTube Monetization and Censorship by Proxy: A Machine Learning Prospective

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

## Future Plans

Please include here

- Neko will leverage its community (26k+) to advertise and spotlight Only Coins. Neko will also showcase Only Coins by hosting all past and future Neko content videos on the platform. Neko will also migrate the Learn-2-earn program to provide rewards to users interacting with videos on-chain.
- In addition to additional BOS app integrations, Only Coins could be expanded to integrate live AMA/Video hosting similar to twitter spaces or twitch.
